            Sorry for being gone. I'm down at a conference for PLTW for the next three days. I was going to let you know on Friday, then by the time I realized we didn't have school on Friday, you were already gone. So, my apologies. Please message me through <a href="https://hangouts.google.com" target="_blank">Hangouts</a> if you have any questions.

            <span style="font-size:30px;">Above is a secret phrase. Some may find it easy to figure out, and others may not. We'll have Python help us to figure it out. Use <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ewwjoDHYZy-8UvjLlEvgHiCVsTVW61qox7C-HCOVfGs/edit?usp=sharing">this link</a> to learn more. (On a side note, the secret phrase is a somewhat famous quote, and all capitalization and punction has been removed.)
