            Sorry for not being here today. I miss you guys (well, most of you anyway...). :) Today I'd like you to take a look at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kEtONENvmA_pDEVhYYCAWZZVHQbd6ozFF9DRWEmwxn8/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">review sheet</a> of some of the HTML and Python we have learned this semester. Please work on describing what each of the HTML tags do and answer the questions about Python. It's definitely not an exhaustive list of everything we've done this semester, but hopefully it helps to remind you of some of the stuff you may have forgotten. Please use Google to help you with the things you may not remember.<br><br> If you get done early with that, please work through some more Python on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Learning Log</a> as well. I do plan on being back tomorrow, so I will see you all then. Be good for the sub. And PLEASE, no food or drinks in class.
