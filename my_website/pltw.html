                Please use the information above to work on your website. Remember, you need at least three parts to your website, the main page (index.html), a Portfolio page, and an About Me page. You can add any other pages you'd like. Don't forget to link the pages together. If you would like, you can use <a href="files/template.html" download>this template</a> (be sure and change the name if you do).<br>
                Also, make sure you have an app you want to post in your portfolio. When you get your webpages done, you make work in Scratch on an app.
