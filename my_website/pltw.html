            Sorry for not being here today. Today I'd like you to please work on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Python Learning Log</a> for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a>. If you have not yet completed <a href="https://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a> and would rather work on that, you may do that as well. Lastly, if you do a quick Google Search of Python, there are many other resources available that could be very helpful (Google has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">"Python Course"</a> that I have used before...if you do use that one, you can use it with the Canopy Python software on your computer). Feel free to use any of those as well, just be sure to fill out and submit the learning log before the end of the period. Thank you.
