            Today, you will create an app in App Inventor and answer some questions about it on this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15v5nB3PsxNjcLlTwO7E5W20dEu6JPZQ8UVPzSam0rFc/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Doc</a>. Sorry I cannot demonstrate it on the board, but please do not hesitate to ask myself or your neighbor questions. Please share the Google Doc with me when finished.
