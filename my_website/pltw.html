            Thank you to those that remixed the straight line art project. (Specifically, Dr_Minecraft and RandomPerson05155.) If you did remix and I didn't mention you, please make sure you share it.<br>
            Today you will go to <a href="https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick">https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick</a> and create an account. You MUST put in your correct first name and last initial, otherwise I won't know who to give credit to. After you've created your account and selected your "hero", click the blue "Start" button to get started. (Please keep your volume down/off so the sub doesn't have to ask you to do so. Or feel free to use headphones.) Try to get through at least Level 8 "Loop Da Loop". After that feel free to work on more levels or work on your website or Scratch app, BUT PLEASE STAY BUSY WITH CLASSWORK AND NOT GAMES (except CodeCombat).<br><br>

            Remix the art project I created yesterday (embedded below and 'code' accessible <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123911365/">here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123911365/</a>). At the moment, the project draws only straight lines to create the picture. Add to it so you can make the same design in all four quadrants (remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)#/media/File:Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg" target="_blank">quadrants of the cartesian plane</a>? my design currently resides only in Quadrant I). Remember, only straight lines.<br> Or, feel free to create any other <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=string+art+kits&rlz=1C1WERZ_enUS703US703&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=854&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJibHlrsDPAhVs64MKHfMlDIMQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&q=straight+line+art" target="_blank">Straight-Line Art Project</a>.<br>
