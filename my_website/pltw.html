            Sorry for not being here today. I am at home with two sick children, and believe me, I would be happy to trade positions with anyone. :) Please work on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a> today. Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Learning Log</a> that we've been using. Please be sure you're on a Python course. Feel free to message me through Hangouts if you have any questions. I will get back to you right away if I am near my phone...if not, I guess I will get back to you tomrrow. Thank you and hope to be back tomorrow.<br><br>
