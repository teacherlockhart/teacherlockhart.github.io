            Sorry for not being here today. I'm over in 510 protoring tests. Today I'd like you to do the same as yesterday, please work on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Python Learning Log</a> for <a href="https://www.codecademy.com">Code Academy</a>. If you have not yet completed <a href="https://codecombat.com/">Code Combat</a> and would rather work on that, you may do that as well. Lastly, if you do a quick Google Search of Python, there are many other resources available that could be very helpful (Google has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/edu/python/">"Python Course"</a> that I have used before...if you do use that one, you can use it with the Canopy Python software on your computer). Feel free to use any of those as well, just be sure to fill out and submit the learning log before the end of the period. Thank you.<br><br>
            On a small side note, an interesting website to check out to see some of the things that have been done with (semi-basic) code is <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. Click on some of the thumbnails to see what others have created and you can also see the code they used to get that. I'm not familiar with all the code (there are some variations of HTML and CSS) but it's still neat to look at.
