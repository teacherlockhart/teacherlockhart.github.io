            Sorry for not being here today. I'm home sick, and believe me, I'd rather be at school with you guys. Please work on <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy.com</a> today. Use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/edit?usp=copy">Learning Log</a> that we've been using. Please be sure you're on a Python course. Thank you and hope to be back tomorrow.
