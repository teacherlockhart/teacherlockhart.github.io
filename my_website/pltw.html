            Sorry, just realized I forgot to push over the HTML file on Frebruary 24, so this website still looked the same. Glad you found the Python learning log file. Thanks for being so adaptive.<br><br>
            If you have any questions from yesterday's presentation with Mr. Gonzalez (sorry Chio, Chasity, and Cullen, you might not know what I'm talking about) please feel free to post a message in <a href="https://classroom.google.com" target="_blank">Google Classroom</a>, or if you want it to be semi-anonymous, you can e-mail me through <a href="https://www.gmail.com" target="_blank">Gmail</a>.<br><br>
            Today, I want you to please work on a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Python Learning Log</a> for Code Academy or work through <a href="https://codecombat.com/" target="_blank">CodeCombat</a>.<br><br>
            Whatever you do, please be good for the sub. Thank you, and I'll see you tomorrow.
