            August 29, 2016 - Sorry I am gone. You have two options today. You must choose at least one!<br>
            <ul style="font-size:20px;">
                <li>Option A: Keep designing webpage. Design it to look better than this one.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must include a non-all-white background (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_bgcolor_css" target="_blank">hint 1</a> or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_background_css" target="_blank">hint 2</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 5 links to other webpages (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 3 images (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_image_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Please be creative and try to incorporate things we didn't talk about in class, like these bullet points.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Option B: Create a story using <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must use at least two seperate characters that are not the cat.</li>
                    <li>Each non-cat sprite must have at least two seperate lines of dialogue.</li>
                    <li>You must have at least two backgrounds that are not the plain white background.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118316256/" target="_blank">Example one</a>. (This one is good, but it doesn't have dialogue like yours will need.)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118591762/" target="_blank">Example two</a>. (Please use your headphones for this one. Sound is not necessary in your story.)</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            Using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120633494/" target="_blank">this scratch project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120633494/)</a>, finish designing the maze and add and ending. You'll also need to add some more scripts to make everything work properly. For bonus points, you can make a bit of a competition by counting how many times the wall was touched, or adding a timer, or anything else you think might make it more exciting.
