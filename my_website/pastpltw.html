            August 29, 2016 - Sorry I am gone. You have two options today. You must choose at least one!<br>
            <ul style="font-size:20px;">
                <li>Option A: Keep designing webpage. Design it to look better than this one.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must include a non-all-white background (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_bgcolor_css" target="_blank">hint 1</a> or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_background_css" target="_blank">hint 2</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 5 links to other webpages (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 3 images (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_image_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Please be creative and try to incorporate things we didn't talk about in class, like these bullet points.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Option B: Create a story using <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must use at least two seperate characters that are not the cat.</li>
                    <li>Each non-cat sprite must have at least two seperate lines of dialogue.</li>
                    <li>You must have at least two backgrounds that are not the plain white background.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118316256/" target="_blank">Example one</a>. (This one is good, but it doesn't have dialogue like yours will need.)</li>

You'll also need to add some more scripts to make everything work properly. For bonus points, you can make a bit of a competition by counting how many times the wall was touched, or adding a timer, or anything else you think might make it more exciting.

At the moment, the project draws only straight lines to create the picture.

Remember, only straight lines.<br> Or, feel free to create any other <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=string+art+kits&rlz=1C1WERZ_enUS703US703&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=854&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJibHlrsDPAhVs64MKHfMlDIMQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&q=straight+line+art" target="_blank">Straight-Line Art Project</a>.<br>

            Thank you to those that remixed the straight line art project. (Specifically, Dr_Minecraft and RandomPerson05155.) If you did remix and I didn't mention you, please make sure you share it.<br>
            Today you will go to <a href="https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick">https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick</a> and create an account. You MUST put in your correct first name and last initial, otherwise I won't know who to give credit to. After you've created your account and selected your "hero", click the blue "Start" button to get started. (Please keep your volume down/off so the sub doesn't have to ask you to do so. Or feel free to use headphones.) Try to get through at least Level 8 "Loop Da Loop". After that feel free to work on more levels or work on your website or Scratch app, BUT PLEASE STAY BUSY WITH CLASSWORK AND NOT GAMES (except CodeCombat).<br><br>

                <li>Use the picture below to help finish your code for our Tip Calculator.<br><img src="images/codeBlocks.PNG" style="border:solid 1px;"><br>
                    <ul><li>Add a space to also calculate a 25% tip and an 18% tip. (You'll have to add some labels to the screen as well as code.)</li>

                    <li>BONUS: Have it calculate the total bill with the tax included (let's say tax is 8%).</li>
                    <li>BONUS: Make it calculate how much you'll pay in total with the tip.</li>

            Sorry for not being here today. I miss you guys (well, most of you anyway...). :) Today I'd like you to take a look at this <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kEtONENvmA_pDEVhYYCAWZZVHQbd6ozFF9DRWEmwxn8/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">review sheet</a> of some of the HTML and Python we have learned this semester. Please work on describing what each of the HTML tags do and answer the questions about Python. It's definitely not an exhaustive list of everything we've done this semester, but hopefully it helps to remind you of some of the stuff you may have forgotten. Please use Google to help you with the things you may not remember.<br><br> If you get done early with that, please work through some more Python on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a> and fill out the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yq5ndPylOAFwPG79PU5W9kefC39Ci7FgDfrzB88OZZY/copy?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Learning Log</a> as well.

            Sorry for not being here today. I'm over in 510 protoring tests.

            On a small side note, an interesting website to check out to see some of the things that have been done with (semi-basic) code is <a href="http://codepen.io/" target="_blank">CodePen</a>. Click on some of the thumbnails to see what others have created and you can also see the code they used to get that. I'm not familiar with all the code (there are some variations of HTML and CSS) but it's still neat to look at.
