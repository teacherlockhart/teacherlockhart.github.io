            August 29, 2016 - Sorry I am gone. You have two options today. You must choose at least one!<br>
            <ul style="font-size:20px;">
                <li>Option A: Keep designing webpage. Design it to look better than this one.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Must include a non-all-white background (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_bgcolor_css" target="_blank">hint 1</a> or <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_body_background_css" target="_blank">hint 2</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 5 links to other webpages (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_link_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Must include at least 3 images (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tryit.asp?filename=tryhtml_image_test" target="_blank">hint</a>).</li>
                    <li>Please be creative and try to incorporate things we didn't talk about in class, like these bullet points.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <li>Option B: Create a story using <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">Scratch</a>.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must use at least two seperate characters that are not the cat.</li>
                    <li>Each non-cat sprite must have at least two seperate lines of dialogue.</li>
                    <li>You must have at least two backgrounds that are not the plain white background.</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118316256/" target="_blank">Example one</a>. (This one is good, but it doesn't have dialogue like yours will need.)</li>
                    <li><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/118591762/" target="_blank">Example two</a>. (Please use your headphones for this one. Sound is not necessary in your story.)</li>

            Using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120633494/" target="_blank">this scratch project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/120633494/)</a>, finish designing the maze and add and ending. You'll also need to add some more scripts to make everything work properly. For bonus points, you can make a bit of a competition by counting how many times the wall was touched, or adding a timer, or anything else you think might make it more exciting.

            Remix the art project I created yesterday (embedded below and 'code' accessible <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123911365/">here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/123911365/</a>). At the moment, the project draws only straight lines to create the picture. Add to it so you can make the same design in all four quadrants (remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrant_(plane_geometry)#/media/File:Cartesian_coordinates_2D.svg" target="_blank">quadrants of the cartesian plane</a>? my design currently resides only in Quadrant I). Remember, only straight lines.<br> Or, feel free to create any other <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=string+art+kits&rlz=1C1WERZ_enUS703US703&espv=2&biw=1440&bih=854&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjJibHlrsDPAhVs64MKHfMlDIMQ_AUIBygC#tbm=isch&q=straight+line+art" target="_blank">Straight-Line Art Project</a>.<br>

            Thank you to those that remixed the straight line art project. (Specifically, Dr_Minecraft and RandomPerson05155.) If you did remix and I didn't mention you, please make sure you share it.<br>
            Today you will go to <a href="https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick">https://codecombat.com/students?_cc=PullStarThick</a> and create an account. You MUST put in your correct first name and last initial, otherwise I won't know who to give credit to. After you've created your account and selected your "hero", click the blue "Start" button to get started. (Please keep your volume down/off so the sub doesn't have to ask you to do so. Or feel free to use headphones.) Try to get through at least Level 8 "Loop Da Loop". After that feel free to work on more levels or work on your website or Scratch app, BUT PLEASE STAY BUSY WITH CLASSWORK AND NOT GAMES (except CodeCombat).<br><br>
