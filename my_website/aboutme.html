        <h1><img src="images\wyoming.jpg"><br>About Me</h1>
        <p>I was born and raised in a small town in Wyoming with a population of about 6,000 people. We had one high school in the town that had about 500 people and there were about 90 other students that graduated with me.</p>
        <p>After high school, I attended the University of Wyoming where I graduate in 2006 with a degree in Mathematics and Math Education.</p>
        <p>I have been teaching at East Bakersfield High School since August 2006.</p>
        <p>Outside school, I have a wife and two children, both girls. We enjoy traveling. We went to Taiwan during the spring break of 2016. We frequently go down to L.A. and the beach. I also enjoy working on computers and learning how they work.</p>
